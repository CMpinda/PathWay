    From a young age football has been a part of my life, I love playing it and I love to help people get better at it. For a long period of my life I used to play Sunday League, it was a lot of fun and I miss it. It was when I got to college I thought about going to America to study and play football (soccer) at a university.
</p>
<p>
    So I made it happen, I got into a Junior College in California. 2015 August I left London to go California on my own, I was 18 at the time, so it was a big step in my life. I was enjoying my time there until I tore my ACL and Meniscus in my left knee. This was the worse injury I ever had, it was a big set back because I missed 2 seasons. 
</p>
<p>
    During this time of my injury I had time to improve the way I play mentally, because menatlity is a big part of football, I learnt a lot just from watching the team play and from the tactics the coach came up with. It helped me see a different perspective of how to play. Even though I couldn't play the second season I still wanted to be part of the team so I decided to assist the coach with recording games and taking pictures. While I was recoding games I could see the field clearer than everyone else, so during the half time team talks, I would talk to certain players about how the game is going and what they can do to improve. By doing this it made me realise that I do like coaching, well being an assistant, thats because I like seeing footballers do well and play well.
</p>
<p>
    After that second season, I done all I could to get back to playing again and it worked, I got to play some of the third season then I transfered to Texas and played there for a year then I came home because I got injured again. So now I am back, I thought about finding a way to help players the best way I can and get them to reach their goals.
